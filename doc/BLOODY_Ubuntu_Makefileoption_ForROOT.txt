-Wl,--no-as-needed

i.e., in the Makefile in Ubuntu, it should be: 

CFLAGS = $(LOCAL_INC)  -isystem$(ROOTINCDIR) -I$(VIP_COMMON_LIB_DIR)/include/ -I$(CLHEP_BASE_DIR)/include/ -Wl,--no-as-needed

(instead of: CFLAGS = $(LOCAL_INC)  -isystem$(ROOTINCDIR) -I$(VIP_COMMON_LIB_DIR)/include/ -I$(CLHEP_BASE_DIR)/include/)

Without this, reading root files will crash (with some obviously completely incomprehensible error message). 
Root is beautiful, Makefiles are beautiful, linker flags are beautiful, and I just wasted one hour to find out why my program crashed.......

Oh, and by the way, if you are NOT on Ubuntu, these flags should NOT be there... (nice, isn't it?!)
