
Many changes have been implemented in january and februari of 2015.
A summary: 

1) Instead of three XXX_HitReconstruction classes, 
	there is now only 1 "DetHitReconstruction" which inherits from HitReconstructionClass
	(so much code-duplication (PEM/PET but also CC) has been removed.) 

2) Code duplication from PET/PEM/CC_DoProcess has been moved to general DoProcess base class, 
	only specific code stays in detector-specific code

3) ProcessDataClass has been updated A LOT. Now, it is much easier to read in and write out events in "LM" format 
	(instead of reading in ROOT files). This is now possible for PET, PEM, CC and "CCPET"

4) The general "BaseClass" (which basically was the baseclass for all other classes and stored pointer to "general objects" (i.e. "histograms" etc..) has been removed. 
   Each class only stores pointers to what it needs (it can still be optimized more probably)

5) The old DetectorParameterClass and its subclasses (PET/PEM/CC_detector) have been removed. 
	- To avoid (a lot!) of code duplication (especially PET/PEM)
	- To seperate scanner_type (PET/PEM/CC/CCPET) from detector-type (scatterer/absorber) and coincidence type (PET or CC)
	TODO: this still can be improved much. 

   Instead of this, we now have the Scanner class, the DetectorFactory class and the Detector class

6) For PET/PEM, there is only one PET_EvClassification, PET_CoincidenceClassification and PET_CoincidenceFinder
  (again: to avoid code-duplication, these codes do exactly the same for PET and PEM)

7) Other: 
	- some variable names and method-names have changed
	- some base-classes have changed methods (some methods are moved to be specific for some subclasses)
	- a lot of "double" and "string" and class-type parameters for methods calls have been made "const &"
	- destructors of baseclasses are now all virtual
	- added inline functions 
	- made private data and methods really private
	- TODO: check memory leaks!! Are all objects deleted?
	- ...
